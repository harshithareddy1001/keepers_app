Created with CodeSandbox
The Keepers App is a simple note-taking web application built with React.js. 
It allows users to create, view, and manage their notes easily. The app has an input area for adding new notes. 
It uses React's useState hook to keep track of the notes. Users can add a new note by typing the title and content in the input area and clicking the add button. 
The new note then appears in the list of notes. Each note has a delete button, which users can click to remove the note from the list. This app shows how React.js can make building dynamic and easy-to-use web applications simple and effective.
